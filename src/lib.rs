//! # Embedded Websocket
//!
//! `embedded_websocket` facilitates the encoding and decoding of websocket frames and can be used
//! for both clients and servers. The library is intended to be used in constrained memory
//! environments like embedded microcontrollers which cannot reference the rust standard library.
//! It will work with arbitrarily small buffers regardless of websocket frame size as long as the
//! websocket header can be read (2 - 14 bytes depending on the payload size and masking).
//! Since the library is essentially an encoder or decoder of byte slices, the developer is free to
//! use whatever transport mechanism they chose. The examples in the source repository use the
//! TcpStream from the standard library.
